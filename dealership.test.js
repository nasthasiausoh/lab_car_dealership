/* Moving on to the Customer and customer.test next:
in Zsolt's review he did an integrated test where he expected 3 things to happen when selling the Â£20,000 BMW to anna
1) customer.car = newCar
2) cars in stock = 2 (since there was only 3 cars to begin with, so now one less = 2)
3) customer.wallet reducing by 20,000 so now only equalling 0 because anna's wallet was only equal to 20,000

in his dealership class he created another method called sellCar
and had a indexOfCarToSell -> he found the index of the car he wanted to sell and 
then removed it from the array by splicing it.
